Pairtree
========
Pairtree infers the phylogeny underlying a cancer using genomic mutation data.
Pairtree is particularly suited to settings with multiple tissue samples from
each cancer, providing separate estimates of subclone frequency from each sample
that constrain the set of consistent phylogenies. The algorithm consists of two phases:

1. Compute pairwise relation tensor over all mutations (or clusters of
   mutations). This provides the probability over each of four possible
   evolutionary relationships between each pair of mutations `A` and `B`.

2. Use the pairwise relation tensor to sample possible phylogenies, assigning a
   likelihood to each. As each phylogeny is sampled, Pairtree computes the
   subclone frequency of each mutation (or cluster of mutations) within the
   tree, balancing the need to fit the observed mutation data while still
   obeying tree constraints.

   The algorithm is described in [Reconstructing complex cancer evolutionary
   histories from multiple bulk DNA samples using
   Pairtree](https://doi.org/10.1158/2643-3230.BCD-21-0092) (Wintersinger et al.
   (2022)).
   
   The practical aspects of using Pairtree are described in our STAR protocol paper [Reconstructing cancer phylogenies using Pairtree, a clone tree reconstruction algorithm](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36129821/) (Kulman et al. (2022)).

Installing Pairtree
===================
For more details on installation, please see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0080).
1. Install dependencies. Installation is usually easiest if you use
   [Mambaforge](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge), which
   includes a recent version of Python alongside the
   [Mamba](https://github.com/mamba-org/mamba) package manager. As Mamba is a
   faster reimplementation of Conda, you can alternatively use Conda or
   Miniconda.

   Refer to [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for the full list of
   dependencies. These can be installed in a new environment with the following
   commands. If you're using Anaconda instead of Mamba, replace `mamba` with
   `conda` below.

   To install all requirements using `mamba` (or `conda`), first clone
   the Pairtree repository and then create a new virtual environment with the
   dependencies.
   
        git clone https://github.com/jwintersinger/pairtree
        mamba create --name pairtree --file requirements.txt

   Or install the dependencies in your current environment:
   
        git clone https://github.com/jwintersinger/pairtree   
        conda create -n pairtree --file requirements.txt --yes
        conda activate pairtree

   Pairtree has only been tested on Linux systems, but should work on any
   UNIX-like OS (including macOS).

3. Download and build the C code required to fit subclone frequencies to the
   tree. This algorithm was published in [Jia et al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01129),
   and uses the authors' implementation with minor modifications.

        git clone https://github.com/jwintersinger/pairtree
        cd pairtree/lib
        git clone https://github.com/jwintersinger/projectppm
        cd projectppm
        bash make.sh

4. Download plotting requirements. Unfortunately, not all plotting requirements Pairtree uses are available via conda.
   Instead, we recommend downloading them via pip.  (optional)

        pip3 install -r plot_requirements.txt


Examples
=========

After installing Pairtree, you can test your installation using provided
example data.

        PTDIR=$HOME/path/to/pairtree
        cd $PTDIR/example
        mkdir results && cd results
        # Run Pairtree.

For a more detailed example of how to run Pairtree and interpret the results, please see our STAR Protocols paper [Reconstructing cancer phylogenies using Pairtree, a clone tree reconstruction algorithm](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X).


Pairtree executables
====================
Pairtree provides several executable files to be used at different stages of
your clone-tree-building pipeline. You can run each executable with the
`--help` flag to get full usage instructions.

* `bin/clustervars`: cluster variants into subclones suitable for building
  clone trees with `bin/pairtree`. Please see the [Clustering
  mutations](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0095) section for full instructions.

* `bin/plotvars`: plot information about your variant clusters before
  proceeding with your Pairtree run. This step is optional. If
  `--plot-relations` is specified, the pairwise relations between subclones
  will be computed and plotted, but at a considerable computational cost.

* `bin/pairtree`: the main Pairtree executable, used for building clone trees.
  See the [Input files](#input-files) and [Tweaking Pairtree
  options](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0040) sections for more information specific
  to this step.

* `bin/plottree`: plot results of your Pairtree run. This will plot a single
  clone tree, which by default will be the one with highest likelihood. See
  [Interpreting Pairtree output](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0110) for details.

* `bin/summposterior`: summarize the posterior distribution over clone trees
  from your Pairtree run by representing this distribution as a graph, and by
  showing the best individual tree samples. See [Interpreting Pairtree
  output](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0105) for details.


Input files
===========
Pairtree requires two input files. See [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0040) for more details.

SSM file
---------
Pairtree needs a `.ssm` (i.e., simple somatic mutation) file, which provides
integer counts of the number of variant and total reads at each mutation locus
in each tissue sample. The `.ssm` file is tab-delimited, with the first line
serving as a header, and each subsequent line providing data for one mutation.
You may wish to consult [an example .ssm file](example/example.ssm).

The `.ssm` file contains the following fields:

  * `id`: a unique ID used to identify the variant. The first mutation should
    be assigned ID `s0`, with subsequent variants assigned `s1, s2, ...`.
    Generally, these should be contiguous, but this is not enforced, so you
    should be able to delete variants from this file without adjusting
    subsequent IDs. The `s` prefix indicates that the ID corresponds to an
    SSM.

  * `name`: a text string used to label variants in Pairtree's output. This
    can be a gene name, genome position (e.g., `1_12345` may be used to
    represent that the variant occurred on `chr1` at position `12345`), or any
    other string. Spaces may be used, and uniqueness of `name`s is not
    enforced (though duplicate names may lead to confusing output).

  * `var_reads`: a comma-separated vector of how many whole-number-valued
    genomic reads at this mutation's locus corresponded to the variant allele
    in each tissue sample. Tissue samples may be provided in any order, so long
    as this order is consistent for all mutations. The names of the associated
    tissue samples are given in the `.params.json` file, detailed below. If
    running with only a single tissue sample, this field contains only a single
    scalar value for each mutation. If a variant has been called in only a
    subset of your tissue samples, consult the [Imputing read
    counts](#imputing-read-counts-for-mutations-missing-in-some-samples)
    section.

  * `total_reads`: a comma-separated vector of the total number of
    whole-number-valued genomic reads observed at this mutation's locus in each
    tissue sample. Thus, the variant allele frequency (VAF) is given by
    `var_reads / total_reads`. If a variant has been called in only a subset of
    your tissue samples, consult the [Imputing read
    counts](#imputing-read-counts-for-mutations-missing-in-some-samples)
    section.

  * `var_read_prob`: a comma-separted vector of probabilities `\omega_{j1},
    \omega_{j2}, ..., \omega_{js}, ..., \omega_{jS}`, where `S` is the total
    number of tissue samples. The value `\omega_{js}` indicates the probabilty
    of observing a read from the variant allele for mutation `j` in a cell
    bearing the mutation. Thus, if mutation `j` occurred at a diploid locus,
    we should have `\omega_{js} = 0.5`. In a haploid cell (e.g., male sex
    chromosome), we should have `\omega_{js} = 1.0`. If a copy-number
    aberration (CNA) duplicated the reference allele in the lineage bearing
    mutation `j` prior to `j` occurring, there will be two reference alleles
    and a single variant allele in all cells bearing `j`, such that
    `\omega_{js} = 0.3333`. Thus, these values give Pairtree the ability to
    correct for the effect CNAs have on the relationship between VAF (i.e.,
    the proportion of alleles bearing the mutation) and subclonal frequency
    (i.e., the proportion of cells bearing the mutation).

Parameters file
---------------
Pairtree also needs a `.params.json` file, which provides parameters for the Pairtree run.
You may wish to consult [an example .params.json file](example/example.params.json).

The `.params.json` file denotes three objects:

* `samples` (required): list of sample names, provided in the same order as
  entries in the `var_reads` and `total_reads` vectors in the `.ssm` file. Each
  sample name can be an arbitrary string.

* `clusters` (required): list-of-lists denoting variant clusters, each of which
  corresponds to a subclone. Each sub-list contains strings corresponding to
  the IDs of all variants that belong to a given cluster. All variants
  belonging to a cluster are assumed to share the same subclonal frequency in a
  given tissue sample, with the VAFs of each variant serving as a noisy
  estimate of this subclonal frequency after using `var_read_prob` to correct
  for ploidy. See the [section on clustering mutations](#clustering-mutations)
  for instructions on how to use Pairtree to build clusters. Pairtree assumes
  that all variants within a cluster share the same subclonal frequencies
  across all cancer samples. Ploidy-corrected estimates of these frequencies
  can be obtained by dividing a variant's VAF by its variant read probability
  `omega.

* `garbage` (optional): list of IDs in the `.ssm` file that you do not want
  Pairtree to use in building your clone tree. Specifying variants as `garbage`
  can be useful when you want to exclude variants without having to remove them
  from the `.ssm` file, allowing you to easily re-introduce them to your clone
  tree in the future. Typically, you might remove a variant because you've
  determined that it violates the infinite sites assumption (ISA); because you
  think the associated read count data is likely erroneous; or because the
  variant was subject to a complex copy-number configuration that skews the
  relationship between VAF and subclonal frequency (e.g., the variant appears
  in different copy-number states in different subclones).


Imputing read counts for mutations missing in some samples
==========================================================
When some of your mutations appear in only some of your samples, you must
impute the total read count for those mutations in the samples where they're
not present. While the variant read count should clearly be zero in such cases,
the value the total read count should take is unclear. This task is important,
however, because it informs Pairtree how confident you are that the variant is
indeed not present in the sample -- an instance where you have zero variant
reads amongst ten total reads indicates considerably less confidence than if
you have zero variant reads for 1000 total reads.

To impute missing read counts, the best option is to refer to the original
sequencing data (e.g., the BAM file) to determine how many reads were present
at the locus in the given sample. As this task can be arduous, you may
alternatively wish to take the mean read count across samples for that genomic
locus, or the mean read count for all loci in that sample. More complex
strategies that try to correct for variable depth across loci (e.g., because of
GC bias) or differing depths across samples (e.g., because some samples were
more deeply sequenced than others) are also possible.


Clustering mutations
====================
Pairtree requires mutations be clustered into subclones. For an example of how to use 
Pairtree's clustering utilities, please see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0095). These clusters should
be provided to Pairtree in the `.params.json` file using the `clusters` array,
described above. Pairtree works best with thirty or fewer subclones, but can
build (less accurate) clone trees for 100 subclones or more.

To build clusters, you have three options.

1. Don't actually cluster mutations into subclones. That is, instead of
   building a *clone tree*, you can build  a  *mutation tree* instead in which
   each cluster contains only a single variant. You must still specify the
   clusters in your `.params.json` file, but you simply list a separate cluster
   for each variant. This works best for a small number of mutations (30 or
   fewer), and so is most suitable for sequencing data obtained from WES or
   targetted sequencing rather than WGS.

2. Use one of many published clustering methods, such as
   [PyClone-VI](https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-020-03919-2).
   You must translate these methods' outputs into Pairtree's format, but this
   is typically easy.

3. Use Pairtree to cluster the variants.

Pairtree provides two clustering models. As Pairtree's focus is not on variant
clustering, its clustering algorithms are less well-validated than its tree
building, and so you may obtain better results with other algorithms.
Nevertheless, Pairtree's authors have had reasonably good success with its
cluster-building methods. Pairtree's two clustering models both use a Dirichlet
process mixture model (DPMM), but differ in how they use the model.

You can use Pairtree to cluster variants through the `bin/clustervars`
executable. Run with `--help` to obtain full usage instructions. Several
options are of particular interest.

* `ssm_fn`: Input SSM file with mutations.

* `in_params_fn`: Input params file listing sample names and any existing garbage mutations.

* `out_params_fn`: Output params file with cluster assignments for each mutation (excluding those listed in garbage mutations).

* `--model linfreq`: This uses the default "lineage frequency" clustering model.
  This is the most computationally efficient choice, and is the most
  straightforwrd application of the DPMM to the clustering problem.

* `--model pairwise`: This uses the alternative "pairwise relationships"
  clustering model. In some instances, it may produce better results than
  `linfreq`. This model is typically slower to use, as it requires computing
  pairwise relationships between mutation pairs. For `M` mutations, there are
  `(M choose 2)` such pairs, and so this may become frustratingly slow for more
  than 1000 mutations.

* `--prior <value>`. This is used only with `--model pairwise`. This option
  specifies the prior probability for the coclustering relationship. The
  default of `0.25` corresponds to a uniform relationship over the four
  relationship types (i.e., coclustering, `A` is ancestral to `B`, `B` is
  ancestral to `A`, and `A` and `B` are on different branches). Higher values
  typically result in fewer, larger clusters. Valid values range between 0 and 1.

* `--concentraton <value>`. This is the `log_10{alpha}` used in the DPMM.
  Larger values typically result in more, smaller clusters.

Clustering results are sensitive to the model and parameters used. The best
choice of parameters depends on the nature of your data, including the number
of variants, read depth, and other characteristics. It is often prudent to try
a range of different parameters, plot the results for each using the
`bin/plotvars` executable, and select the clustering that best represents your
data. The best clustering can depend on your application -- for some uses, you
may want more granular clusters that produce a detailed tree with many
subclones, while in other uses, you may want to collapse together similar
subclones to create a simpler tree in which it is easier to discern major
structural differences.


Interpreting and manipulating Pairtree output
=============================================

See [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0105) for further details on interpretting Pairtree's outputs.

Description of the .results.npz file format
--------------------------------------------

Here we provide a brief description of the output file (`.npz`) generated by Pairtree. The `.npz`
file type is a zipped archive consisting of a set of key, value pairs. The `numpy.load` function
can be used to load the contents of an `.npz` file (see the [numpy.load docs](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.load.html)).

When the `pairtree` program completes its execution it saves a `.npz` file with details 
of the trees it found, it's parameter setup, and the results for some of the important computations it performed. 
We detail below some of the most important data Pairtree stores in the `.npz` file:

* `struct`: a list of `parents` vectors sorted by the log-likelihood of how well the tree described by the `parents` vector fits the data. See the following [source code](https://github.com/morrislab/pairtree/blob/master/lib/util.py#L107) to see how to generate an equivalent adjacency matrix from a `parents` vector. 

* `count`: a list containing the number of times a tree (or equivalently a `parents` vector) was found during tree search. The number at index __i__ in the `count` list corresponds to the number of times the tree at index __i__ in the `struct` list was found during tree search.

* `phi`: a list of matrices, where the matrix at index __i__ contains the tree constrained subclonal frequency fit to the tree at index __i__ in the `struct` list. Each row of the phi matrix corresponds to a cluster, and each column corresponds to its tree constrained subclonal frequencing in a particular sample. 

* `llh`: a list containing the tree log-likelihoods. The value at index __i__ in the `llh` list corresponds to the log-likelihood of the tree at index __i__ in the `struct` list. 

* `prob`: a list containing the tree posterior probabilities. The value at index __i__ in the `prob` list corresponds to the posterior probability of the tree at index __i__ in the `struct` list.

It's important to note that all of these lists are sorted in descending order based on tree log-likelihood. Therefore, the data at index 0 in each of these lists corresponds to the data for the best fitting tree.


Understanding the html file format outputted by `bin/plottree`
---------------------------------------------------------------
The `bin/plottree` script uses the .npz file outputted by `bin/pairtree`
to produce an html of plots and figures describing the results.

The title and description for each plot/figure are provided below.

* `Tree`: shows a graphical representation of the clonal evolution tree based on the
variant clusters provided to `bin/pairtree` in the parameter file. These clusters are each labeled as their own
subclone population (`S0`, `S1`, ...). There are three different additional values provided with the tree.
`tidx` is the tree index of which tree from the .npz file is being displayed.
`nlglh` is the negative log-likelihood of the tree.
`prob` is posterior softmax probability of the tree.

* `Population frequencies`: shows the ratio of optimal subclone population frequencies when constrained by the proposed tree for each
sample specified in the `.params.json` file provided to `bin/pairtree`.
There are two additional values for each sample: `Clone diversity index` and `Clone and mutation diversity index`.
The `Clone diversity index` is the entropy of subclone population frequency for a given sample.
This is a value from 0 to 1, where 1 means a sample has many different subclone populations (and as a result, a higher entropy), and 0 means a sample has no diversity (or a single subclone, and a lower entropy). The `Clone and mutation diversity index` is the joint entropy of the subclone population frequency and the number of mutations present in a clone.

* `Tree-constrained subclonal frequencies`: shows the optimal subclone population frequency when constrained by the proposed tree.

* `Data-implied subclonal frequencies`: shows the implied subclone population frequency per sample based on the variant data provided.

* `Interleaved subclonal frequencies`: shows the `tree-constrained subclonal frequencies`, as well as the error between the `tree-constrained subclonal frequencies` and the `data-implied subclonal frequencies` for each subclone in a given sample. The `Total Error` value shown is the sum of all errors across subclones and samples.

* `Diversity Indices`: shows the `Clone diversity index`, `Clone and mutation diversity index`,
and `Shannon diversity index` in bits for each sample. The `Clone diversity index`, and
`Clone and mutation diversity index` are described above. The `Shannon diversity index` is
the entropy of the proportion of mutations in each cluster.

* `VAFs (corrected)`: shows a table of variant allele frequencies (VAFs) per sample for the following: tree-constrained subclones (`Φ`), `Supervariants`, `Cluster members`, and `Garbage`. The current selections for the table are highlighted in blue. The `Φ` values are the optimal tree-constrained subclones VAFs (or pseudo-variants denoted by P1, ... ,P_n). The `Supervariants` are the supervariants created for each cluster defined in the `.params.json` file provided to Pairtree. The `Cluster members` are the individual variants in each supervariant or cluster. The `Garbage` variants are those listed as garbage in the `.params.json` file provided to Pairtree. There is also a search bar which allows you to list comma delimited ID values that specify which IDs should be shown in the VAF table (e.g. `s0,s1` will show only these two IDs if there is a match).

* `ML relations`: shows a matrix of the pairwise relationships between all of the different subclone populations. Each relationship is with respect to the subclone on the left hand side of the matrix, to the subclone listed on top of the matrix.

* `garbage`: shows a pairwise relationship matrix of which subclone populations have a garbage relationships.

* `cocluster`: shows a pairwise relationship matrix of which subclone populations are clustered together (or have a cocluster relationship).

* `A_B`: shows a pairwise relationship matrix of which subclone populations have an ancestral relationship to other subclone populations.

* `B_A`: shows a pairwise relationship matrix of which subclone populations have a descendant relationship to other subclone populations.

* `diff_branches`: shows a pairwise relationship matrix of which subclone populations are not on the same branch (i.e. are not ancestors or descendants of each other).

* `Cluster stats`: shows a table of statistics for each cluster. The columns are `Cluster`, `Members`, and `Deviation`. The `Cluster` column lists the ID number for the cluster or subclone. `Members` lists the number of variants in a cluster. `Deviation` lists the median absolute difference between the subclone frequency of the supervariant, and its related cluster of variants.

Exporting Pairtree output to other formats
------------------------------------------
* Use `bin/summposterior` to summarize the posterior distribution over trees
  and `bin/plottree` to plot all details corresponding to an individual tree.
  See the [Pairtree executables](#pairtree-executables) section for details.

* To export Pairtree's visualizations from `bin/plottree` for use in
  publications, try [SVG Crowbar](https://nytimes.github.io/svg-crowbar/). All
  figures Pairtree creates embedded in HTML web pages using the SVG figure
  format, which is suitable for use at arbitrarily high resolutions (including
  in print) because of its vector-based nature. Some of these figures are
  rendered with the Plotly plotting library, though most use custom code that
  ultimately invokes d3.js.

* Alternatively, to export the subset of Pairtree's visualizations that use Plotly without having to open the
  HTML plots in a web browser, try
  [Kaleido](https://github.com/plotly/Kaleidov), which is a Plotly-related
  library for exporting plots without using a browser (accomplished using an
  embedded version of the Chromium web browser). Most Plotly-related calls in
  Pairtree call `plotly.io.to_html(fig, ...)`, which can be replaced by
  [`fig.write_image`](https://plotly.com/python-api-reference/generated/plotly.graph_objects.Figure.html#plotly.graph_objects.Figure.write_imagev).
  
* Unfortunately, for the other plots that don't use Plotly (such as the tree
  structure and subclonal frequency plots), there is no straightforward means
  of rendering them without using a web browser. If SVG Crowbar fails or is
  otherwise not a viable option, try printing the web page containing the plots
  to a PDF file, then opening the PDF in Inkscape. The SVG plts on the web page
  should be stored using a vector representation in the PDF, allowing you to
  copy them from the PDF into a discrete SVG file where they can be manipulated
  as vector images.

* To export the data that `bin/plottree` visualizes for your own analysis, pass
  the `--tree-json <filename>.json` option to `bin/plottree`. This will export
  the data for a given tree to the `<filename>.json` file. For a tree with `K`
  nodes (i.e., the root node representing normal tissue and `K-1` cancerous
  subclones) constructed from `S` cancer samples,  some of the data included
  will be amongst the following.
    
    * `phi`: tree-constrained subclonal frequencies as `KxS` matrix in row-major format
    * `phi_hat`: data-implied subclonal frequencies as `KxS` matrix in row-major format
    * `eta`: population frequencies as `KxS` matrix in row-major format
    * `llh`: tree log likelihood in base e
    * `nlglh`: tree log likelihood normalized to number of subclones and cancer samples in base 2, allowing comparison of trees across datasets to determine how many bits you're paying per subclone per cancer sample
    * `prob`: posterior probability of tree
    * `count`: how many times this tree was sampled in Metropolis-Hastings
    * `parents`: `K-1`-length vector, where `parents[i]` provides the parent of node `i+1`
    * `samples`: names of cancer samples given in input (providing the names associated with each column of the `phi`, `phi_hat`, and `eta` matrices)
    * `cdi`, `cmdi`, `sdi`: `S`-length vectors providing the clonal dviersity index, clone and mutation diversity index, and Shannon diversity index for each sample. Refer to the Pairtree paper for definitions.

* If `stderr` is redirected to a file (e.g., via `bin/pairtree ... 2>
  stderr.log`), instead of rendering a progress bar, Pairtree will report its
  progress by writing to `stderr` a series of JSON objects, with one per line.
  An example line follows:

    ```json
    {"desc": "Sampling trees", "count": 11457, "total": 12000, "unit": "tree", "started_at": "2021-11-01 02:45:37.226015", "timestamp": "2021-11-01 02:46:12.625482"}
    ```

Fixing incorrect ploidy
==========================
There are cases of incorrect ploidy that are unable to be detected using the pairwise framework.
This can result in an implied subclonal frequency being greater than 1. This is often due to missed
copy number calls, such as an uncalled loss of heterozygosity (LOH) event which removes the wildtype
allele in a lineage and leaves only the variant allele. For an example of how to use the 
`util/fix_bad_var_read_prob.py` script, please see [here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S266616672200586X#sectitle0085).

In order to find these mutations such that they can be corrected, we provide the script `util/fix_bad_var_read_prob.py`. There are several options for this script which are of particular interest.

* `--logbf-threshold`: Logarithm of Bayes factor threshold at which the haploid model is accepted as more likely model than the model using the provided var_read_prob.
* `--ignore-existing-garbage`: Ignore any existing garbage variants listed in `in_params_fn` and test all variants. If not specified, any existing garbage variants will be kept as garbage and not tested again.

Removing garbage mutations
==========================
Pairtree relies on the infinite sites assumption (ISA) when converting mutation allele frequencies to subclonal frequencies, and building clone trees. Pairtree is also sensitive to other factors such as missed CNA calls, or technical noise which can skew the subclonal frequency conversion. Therefore, it is necessary to detect and remove such mutations before building the clone tree. Pairwise relationships between mutations reveal both ISA violations and other types of erroneous mutations, which we refer to collectively as _garbage mutations_.

In order to find these mutations such that they can be added to our list of garbage mutations, we provide the script `bin/removegarbage`. There are several options for this script which are of particular interest.

* `--prior`: Pairwise garbage prior probability. The default value of 0.2 represents a uniform prior over pairwise relationship types.
* `--max-garb-prob`: Maximum probability of a garbage relationship to permit for any pair in order for the algorithm to terminate.
* `--ignore-existing-garbage`: Ignore any existing garbage variants listed in `in_params_fn` and test all variants. If not specified, any existing garbage variants will be kept as garbage and not tested again.
* `--pairwise-results`: Filename to store pairwise evidence in, which allows you to try garbage removal with different parameters without having to repeat the pairwise computations.
* `in_ssm_fn`: Input SSM file with mutations.
* `in_params_fn`: Input params file listing sample names and any existing garbage mutations.
* `out_params_fn`: Output params file with modified list of garbage mutations.



Tweaking Pairtree options
=========================
Tweaking some of Pairtree's options can improve the quality of your results or
reduce the method's runtime. The most relevant options are discussed below.
For a full listing of tweakable Pairtree options, including algorithm
hyperparameters, run `pairtree --help`.

Finding better trees by running multiple MCMC chains
----------------------------------------------------
Pairtree samples trees using MCMC chains. Like any optimization algorithm
working with a non-convex objective, Pairtree's chains can become stuck in
local optima. Running multiple MCMC chains helps avoid this, since each chain
starts from a different point in space, and takes a different path through that
space.

By default, Pairtree will run a separate MCMC chain for each CPU core (logical
or physical) present. As these chains are run in parallel, using multiple
chains does not increase runtime. For more details, please refer to the
"Running computations in parallel to reduce runtime" section below.

Changing number of samples, burn-in, and thinning
-------------------------------------------------
Three options control the behaviour of each MCMC chain used to sample trees.

* Number of MCMC samples: by changing the `--trees-per-chain` option, you can
  make each chain sample more or fewer trees. The more samples each chain
  takes, the more likely it is that those samples will be from a good
  approximation of the true posterior distribution over trees permitted by your
  data. By default, Pairtree will take 3000 total samples per chain.

* Burn-in: each chain will take some number of samples to reach high-density
  regions of tree space, such that those trees come from a good approximation
  of the true posterior. The `--burnin` parameter controls what proportion of
  trees Pairtree will discard from the beginning of each chain, so as to avoid
  including poor-quality trees in your results. By default, Pairtree discards
  the first one-third of samples from each chain.

* Thinning: MCMC samples inherently exhibit auto-correlation, since each
  successive sample is based on a perturbation to the preceding one. We can
  reduce this effect by taking multiple samples for each one we record. You can
  change the `--thinned-frac` option to control this behaviour. By default,
  `--thinned-frac=1`, such that every sample taken is recorded. By changing
  this, for instance, to `--thinned-frac=0.1`, Pairtree will only record every
  tenth sample it takes. By recording only a subset of samples taken, the
  computational burden associated with processing the results (e.g., by
  computing summary statistics over the distribution of recorded trees) is
  reduced, alongside the storage burden of writing many samples to disk.

Running computations in parallel to reduce runtime
--------------------------------------------------
Pairtree can leverage multiple CPUs both when computing the pairwise relations
tensor and when sampling trees. Exploiting parallelism when computing the
tensor can drastically reduce Pairtree's runtime, since every pair can be
computed independently of every other. Conversely, exploiting parallelism when
sampling trees won't necessarily improve runtime, since trees are sampled using
MCMC, which is an inherently serial process, While no single MCMC chain can be
run in parallel, however, you can run multiple independent chains in parallel,
as discussed in the previous section. This will help Pairtree avoid local
optima and produce better-quality results.

By default, Pairtree will run in parallel on all present CPUs. (On
hyperthreaded systems, this number will usually be inferred to be twice the
number of physical CPU cores.) You can change this behaviour by specifying the
`--parallel=N` option, causing Pairtree to use `N` parallel processes instead.
When computing the pairwise tensor, Pairtree will compute all pairs in
parallel, such that computing the full tensor using `N` parallel processes
should only take `1/N` as much time as computing with a single process.  Later,
when sampling trees, Pairtree will by default run as many independent MCMC
chains as there are parallel processes. In this scenario, if you have `N` CPUs,
running only a single chain will be no faster than running `N` chains, since
each chain executes concurrently. However, in the `N`-chain case, you will
obtain `N` times as many samples, improving your result quality.

You can explicitly specify `--tree-chains=M` to run `M` chains instead of the
default, which is to run a separate chain for each parallel process. If `M` is
greater than the number of parallel processes `N`, the chains will execute
serially, increasing runtime. (Given the serial execution, you should expect
that tree sampling with `M > N` will take `ceiling(M / N)` times as long as

Fitting subclone frequencies to trees
-------------------------------------
Critical to the Pairtree algorithm is the step of fitting subclone frequencies
to trees. Beyond the user's interpretation of subclone frequencies for
downstream analysis of Pairtree's results, the subclone frequencies will also
affect tree structure -- the data likelihood for a tree is determined by how
well the tree-constrained subclone frequencies fit the observed VAF data. We
provide several different algorithms for computing these frequencies that
strike different balances between computational speed and result accuracy.

* `--phi-fitter=projection`: By default, Pairtree uses the "Efficient
  Projection onto the Perfect Phylogeny Model" algorithm developed in [Jia et
  al.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01129) This uses a Gaussian approximation of
  the binomial likelihood we're trying to maximize.

* `--phi-fitter=rprop`: Uses the [rprop variant of gradient
  descent](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/298623). Separate step sizes
  are maintained for each frequency scalar in each tissue sample. Those step
  sizes are increased when the direction of a step is consistent with the
  previous step taken, and reduced otherwise. Generally, this algorithm will
  produce more accurate results than `projection` (i.e., higher data
  likelihoods for the same tree), since it is directly optimizing the binomial
  objective rather than a Gaussian approximation, but at a higher computational
  cost. The extra computational burden becomes greater with more subclones
  (e.g., 30 or more), while being insignificant for small trees (e.g., with ten
  subclones or fewer).

* `--phi-fitter=proj_rprop`: First run the default `projection` algorithm, then refine its
  results using `rprop`. While this can produce better subclone frequency values
  at the cost of more computation, it has in testing demonstrated little
  benefit to accuracy.

Given the tradeoff between speed and accuracy, `rprop` is recommended for small
trees (e.g., ten subclones or fewer), while `projection` is more suitable for
larger trees. If Pairtree seems to be producing poor results with `projection`,
try with `rprop` instead, as optimizing the exact objective rather than an
approximation may produce better trees.

When running with `--phi-fitter=rprop` or `--phi-fitter=proj_rprop`, you can
adjust the number of iterations the `rprop` algorithm uses by specifying the
`--phi-iterations=N` parameter. Runtime of `rprop` will be proportional to this
parameter, so smaller values will decrease runtime, at the potential cost of
accuracy of subclone frequencies.

While other options are provided (`--phi-fitter=graddesc_old` and
`--phi-fitter=rprop_old`), these remain only as artifacts and will be removed
in future verisons, and so should not be used.
